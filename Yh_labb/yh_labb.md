# Relationships statements for each entity

- A `student` is enrolled in one `class`
- A `student` has exactly one associated `studentInformation` containing sensitive personal data
- A `class` has many `students`
- A `class` belongs to one `program`
- A `class` is managed by one `educational leader`
- A `class` is connected to `multiple` courses through `ClassCourse`
- An `educational leader` can be `responsible` for up to `three classes`
- A `program `includes multiple `classes`
- A `program` can have several `courses`
- A `course` can be part of multiple programs.
- A `course` can be given in `multiple classes` via `ClassCourse`
- A `course` can be taught by multiple educators through EducationalCourse.
- A `ProgramCourse`connects programs to their respective `courses`
- `ClassCourse` links classes to the `courses` they take.
- Each `ClassCourse` is taught by one `educator`
- A `campus` can host multiple `classes`
- An `educator` can teach many courses through `EducationalCourse`
- An `educator`can be assigned to `multiple ClassCourses`
- An `educator` can be a `consultant`

# Arguing for normalisation

The model satisfies `First Normal Form (1NF)` as all attributes are indivisible and contain only a single value. Primary keys are used to uniquely identify each row. Furthermore, the model avoids redundancy by using relationships instead of duplicating dataâ€”many-to-many relationships are handled using bridge tables.

It also fulfills `Second Normal Form (2NF)` by eliminating partial dependencies. Data has been separated into dedicated tables to ensure that all attributes depend solely on their own primary keys. In the bridge tables, all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire composite key.

Finally, the model meets the requirements of `Third Normal Form (3NF)` by avoiding transitive dependencies, "non-primary attributes depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key."
